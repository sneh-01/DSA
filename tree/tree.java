// clock wisw change is root 
// anti change position is last leaf node
// lr ----> r rotatioin and l roation anti c , c
// rl -----> 2 nd and after 3 



// red-black tree
// it is self balancing binary search tree
// rb trees are good at frequent insertion and deletion than lookup (search)
// less rotation than avl tree
// has less                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      memory

// for lookup go with avl tree
// for insertion and deletion go for   red-black tree
